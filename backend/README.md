## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a highly scalable package tracking and courier management solution. By leveraging Kafka for real-time updates and Golang for backend efficiency, it can support large volumes of data and real-time processing, suitable for logistics and courier service applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Golang, Kafka, MySQL
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Development Workflow
1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Set up project structure and Docker infrastructure.
   - Configure the development environment.
   
2. **Core Features**:
   - **Package Management**: Register packages, track status and location, and update shipping status.
   - **Courier Management**: Register couriers, schedule tasks, and manage courier tasks.

3. **Key Features**:
   - **Kafka Integration**: Real-time messaging system for updates and queue management.
   - **User Interface**: A dashboard to track packages, generate reports, and display statistics.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - **Performance Optimization**: Real-time tracking enhancements and large data handling with Kafka.
   - **Security and Scalability**: Implement security features and ensure the system can handle high volumes.

5. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Unit testing for the backend and Kafka components, end-to-end testing for the frontend.
   - Production deployment with monitoring and logging.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Node.js and npm
- Golang
- MySQL (can be set up with Docker)

### Installation Steps

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Node.js and npm
- Golang
- MySQL (can be set up with Docker)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arizdn234/Marlin-Express.git
   cd Marlin-Express
   ```

2. **Set up Docker**:
   Ensure you have Docker installed and running. Use `docker-compose` to initialize the containers.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment variables. Include necessary variables such as database credentials and Kafka broker details.

4. **Run Migrations**:
   Set up the database schema by running migrations:
   ```bash
   # Example using a Go migration tool, e.g., golang-migrate
   migrate -path ./migrations -database "mysql://root:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/package_db" -verbose up
   ```

5. **Run the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go run main.go
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Testing and Deployment

### Testing
- **Backend**: Run unit tests using Go's built-in testing tools:
  ```bash
  go test ./...
  ```
- **Frontend**: Run tests using Jest or React Testing Library:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### Deployment
For production, use Docker to deploy the project:
